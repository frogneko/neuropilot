## Testing

<Aside>

This section is only for testing with a Neuro API server.
Testing with integration tests are considered part of [meta](/neuropilot/contributors/meta).

</Aside>

- Try to test using at least one of the non-AI-backed (Randy, Tony) and optionally one of the AI-backed (Jippity, Gary) simulators.
- In the case of using AI-backed simulators you should also see if they are confused or are avoiding using the tool.

## Demonstration recording

- Use either Tony or Jippity, but it will be more reproducible with Tony, allowing you to easily do multiple tries if you wish.
- Also be aware that Tony has an API that spawns it headlessly (i.e. no GUI), so it may be better to set up a script for that. Store scripts in the `tony/` folder.
- Recordings need to be converted into a GIF file, to reduce bundle sizes when packaging.

<Aside type="tip">

If using `ffmpeg`, the following command can be used to convert a video file to GIF:

```bash
ffmpeg -y -ss <start_time> -t <gif_length> -i "input.mp4" -vf "fps=10,split[s0][s1];[s0]palettegen[p];[s1][p]paletteuse" -loop 0 output.gif
```
