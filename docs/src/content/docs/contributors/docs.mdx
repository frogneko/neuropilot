import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

## General

- All changes must pass the `@astrojs/check` check.
- Styling must actually function before it is merged.

## Content updates

<Aside type="tip">

You don't necessarily need a code editor for content changes, though it's recommended to have one anyways as it will make it much easier.

</Aside>

- Always make new files as `.mdx`, as this allows importing of components if necessary. There's no downside to it either.
- Ensure wording is clear and understandable.
- Don't go off for too long per section in reference pages.

## Component/utility updates

<Aside>

Component updates also apply to SVG assets in src/assets unless otherwise indicated.

</Aside>

- All utility updates must work without any server interaction (beyond the page load interaction)
- All components must be a .astro component (for now)

## Configuration updates

- `content.config.ts` should not be updated (mostly).
- `astro.config.mts` updates should be cross-checked with [Starlight docs](https://starlight.astro.build/) + any plugin docs if necessary.
