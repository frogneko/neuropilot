<Aside>

This page is aimed at people wishing to contribute non-code assets to NeuroPilot (e.g. icons). Code assets should refer back to their [respective category](/neuropilot/contributors).

## Showcase icons

- For security reasons, VS Code doesn't allow SVGs to be loaded (with exceptions). With that being said, we'd like an SVG version as well due to the [NeuroPilot Assets page](/neuropilot/assets) on docs.
- We prefer you use Inkscape since it allows you to import/export SVGs alongside other file formats like JPG or PNG, but it is not a hard requirement.
- You're welcome to feature these anywhere you want (example: #art channel on the Neuro Discord).

## Usage icons

- Keep icons small as there won't be much space to showcase details.
- Be aware of different colour schemes and try not to lock into one specific colour, as this may cause readability issues with certain colour schemes & themes.
