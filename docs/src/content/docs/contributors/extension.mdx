This page covers contributing to the NeuroPilot extension.

## Features

- Discuss why the feature would be helpful (this applies to both user-end and developer-end features).
- Test your code using Tony at least. Testing with Jippity is really only necessary if testing with AI behaviours & understanding is needed.
- If the feature requires access to new dependencies (vscode or npm), note that in your feature request.
{/* - If the feature cannot work on the web build or requires adaptation to work in web, note that in your feature request. */}

<Aside>

Characteristics that could make a feature unavailable in web includes:
- Features which rely on a Node API (though certain modules may be polyfillable just fine)
- Features which rely on a desktop-only extension.
- Features that work differently due to the different environment.

There may be more not listed here but that should get you started.

</Aside>

- For upcoming major features (e.g. NeuroPilot API), discuss this on the Discord thread and wait for, at least, `@Pasu4`'s input.

## Bug fixes, patches, changes

- For minor patches (such as fixing small unintended behaviour), it is generally OK to send a pull request immediately. Otherwise, you should open an issue. If in doubt, just open an issue.
- Ensure fixes don't cause breaking changes whenever possible. Otherwise, note the breaking change.
