## CI (GitHub Actions) :badge["External"]

### Workflows

- Changing CI shouldn't be done often, it should only be changed if something within the project requires it.
- Enabling GitHub Actions on forks is recommended so that you can push your changes and get feedback, however you should disable the publishing workflow on your fork.

### Actions

- Modifying actions is a thing that should be done rarely.
- Unlike most other projects, you **need** to commit the `dist/` folder so the runner can access the code (they won't get built by the runner).
- Try not to create too many

## Linting (ESLint)

- Existing linting rules should not be changed without discussion.
- Linting rule additions should have a purpose.
- Docs lint rules, playground lint rules, and extension lint rules must be kept separate.

## Playground (Extension Development Host folder default)

- You can commit whatever you want (as long as reasonable) in this folder, and it generally will be fine.
- The `.vscode` folder intentionally contains a test.ts file in there for lint + file testing. Do not move it.

## `tsconfig.json` (TypeScript config)

- These should not be modified in most circumstances. In the rare cases they should be, it should be noted why.
- Each part of the project (docs, playground, extension) should maintain their own `tsconfig.json` files.

<Aside type="caution">

In the upcoming web build PR, the extension's `tsconfig.json` will be split into 3 files. This is intentional, do not change this.

</Aside>

## `package.json`/`package-lock.json` (Node/npm package manifests)

- *Only the extension's `package.json` should target the `vscode` engine!* All other package.json files should omit the target object.
- New dependencies should be added on an as-needed basis.
- Dependencies in `docs` should be pinned using `~`. Other package manifests can use any specifier.
- All dependencies should target libraries published on npm as much as possible.

## Pre-commit (Husky)

- Pre-commits should be added sparingly and with reason indicated. Adding too many will increase the delay before being able to commit.
- It is generally fine to overlap checks at CI with pre-commit checks, though once again do take note of the above.

## `.vscode` (Editor config)

- There shouldn't be a reason to modify editor configs most of the time. This does not apply to the playground's editor config.

## `README.md`

- These should explain as much as necessary. If it's too long, move to docs instead of leaving in README.
- README files shouldn't usually refer to another README file.

## Other files :badge[Not sure? Check here!]{variant=success}

- `icons.woff`: Do not modify unless given permission by `@Pasu4`.
- .*ignore: Generally these shouldn't be modified too much, although if something's in the `.gitignore` file, 90% of the time you need to copy it over to `.vscodeignore`
- `LICENSE`: Do not modify.
- `tony/`: See [Contributors/Testing](/neuropilot/contributors/testing).
