## Get/open workspace files

Neuro can get or open files within the workspace. This will either get the list of Neuro-safe files in the workspace, or open files as specified (assuming the path is Neuro-safe).
If a file is already opened, its tab will be focused.

When opening a file, Neuro will be sent the current file as well as her cursor position.

## Create/Delete/Rename files and folders

Neuro can choose to create, delete or rename files and folders within the workspace.
To toggle between deleting a file or folder, Neuro must set the `recursive` parameter to `true`.

This will check for Neuro-unsafe paths before performing said actions.
In the case of renaming, the Neuro-safe path check will happen on both the old and new path.

## Editing files :badge[Not here]{variant=danger}
