## Passive linting contexts

If the [Send New Linting Problems On](/neuropilot/reference/settings#send-new-linting-problems-on) setting is set to a value other than 'Off', Neuro will be informed if a file has gotten new linting problems accordingly.

This setting respects the Neuro-safe path checks.

## Get File/Folder/Workspace Lint Problems

This allows Neuro to get linting problems in any Neuro-safe file/folder or workspace.
This will also include linting analysis contributed by other Language Server extensions (such as the Python/Pylance or C/C++ extensions).

## Ask Neuro to fix/explain

This will send the surrounding context of the relevant file, alongside the lint problem and a pre-determined prompt, to Neuro. prompting her to fix or explain the issue.

<Aside>

Due to the normal inline chat feature being contributed by the Copilot extension and being hardcoded to use `@workspace`, NeuroPilot works around this by sending the prompt in chat.

This therefore means that it will rely on the chat system with action forces and the like.
