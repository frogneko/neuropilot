Git operations has the most amount of actions, so in this page they will be (sort of) sectioned according to their permission.

Each permission here also requires the Git Operations permission to be enabled no matter what.

As this relies on the built-in git extension (and for most, an initialized repo), NeuroPilot will first check if the Git extension is loaded, before registering git actions.
Then, NeuroPilot will check if there already is an initialized repo in the workspace.

You can reinitiate these checks anytime using the [Get dependency extension states](/neuropilot/commands#get-dependency-extension-states) command.

## Vanilla :badge[No perms]{variant=tip}

These actions require no other permission to be enabled than the Git Operations permission.

### Initialize Git Repository :badge[No repo]

Neuro can initialize a local git repository. This will then cause git actions to be registered.
If there is already a git repository, it will reinitialize the repo.

<Aside type="tip">

This is the only action that doesn't require a repo to be present. All other git actions requires a repo to be present.

</Aside>

### Add/Remove files from git

Neuro can add/remove files from the staging index in git. This works just like their respective git commands.

### Make a git commit

Neuro can make a commit herself using the info currently being used by git.

To differentiate between her commits and human commits, the prefix `Neuro commit: <commit title>` will be used.

<Aside type="tip">

The prefix changes partially depending on the [Currently As Neuro API setting](/neuropilot/reference/settings#currently-as-neuro-api).
It changes the attribution in the prefix.

Example: The Currently As Neuro API setting is set to Evil.
The prefix will instead be `Evil commit: <commit title>`.

</Aside>

### Git status

Sends the current status of the git repository to Neuro, fully formatted using Markdown.

### Merge git branches

This allows Neuro to merge git branches together.
This follows the same as merging on the command line, selecting another branch to merge to the current branch.

### Add/Remove/Switch branches

This allows Neuro to add, remove or switch between branches.

### Abort git merges

This is only registered if a merge failed to happen cleanly.
Neuro can use this to abort merging if she can't resolve merge conflicts.

### Diff files

This gets the diff between two states of a file and sends it to Neuro.
This will be sent raw as Neuro will probably understand a diff easier.

This has a complex schema that can't be checked via the normal schema validation and can't be specified via the normal schema specs + the Neuro-specific restrictions.
For this reason, Neuro is more likely to send in an "incorrect" packet using this action.

### Get commit log

This gets the commit log for the branch, formats it to be readable, then sent to Neuro.
Neuro can also specify a limit on how many logs she gets, starting from the most recent and going backwards.

### Get blame attribution

This gets the line-by-line blame attributions for a file and sends it to Neuro.

## Git tags :badge[Extra permissions]{variant=tip}

Neuro can use these actions to manage tags on the repo.
These require the Git Tags permission to be enabled.

### Tag HEAD

This tags the current HEAD commit of the branch.
Neuro can choose to name the tag.

### Delete tag

This deletes a tag from the repository.

## Git remotes :badge[Extra permissions]{variant=tip}

These actions allow Neuro to interact with the remote repository connected to the current repository.
These actions require the Git Remotes permission to be enabled.

### Fetch git commits

This fetches commits from the remote repository for Neuro.
This will then allow her to pull commits.

### Pull git commits

Attempts to fast-forward or merge changes from the remote repository.

### Push git commits

Publishes any unpublished commits online.
This will abort if any issue occurs, even if it's just as simple as requiring a pull before pushing.

### Add/remove/rename git remotes :badge[Extra permissions]{variant=tip}

This allows Neuro to add, remove or rename a git remote.
Renaming simply renames the name set by your local repository, NOT the link to the remote repository.

## Get/set git config :badge[Extra permissions]{variant=tip}

Allows Neuro to get/set a config key in the git configuration.
If getting the git config, Neuro can omit the field for her desired key, which will send her the entire local git config.

<Aside>

Neuro can only directly change the local git configuration, never the global configuration.
This obviously does not apply if you have enabled direct terminal access.
