NeuroPilot's main safety feature is the permissions system. This allows almost fine-grained control over what Neuro is allowed to do and what isn't allowed.

NeuroPilot actually has 2 main types of permissions: action permissions and non-action permissions.

## Action permissions :badge[RCE]{variant=tip}

A constant with action permissions is that they usually have 3 options for their permissions: **Off**, **Copilot**, and **Autopilot**.  
If you can't decide which one to choose, [visit this page](/neuropilot/guides/pilot).

All permissions are set to 'Off' by default, except one.

### File interactions

This category of permissions covers actions related to files themselves.  
To see the features covered by these permissions, go to [this page](/neuropilot/reference/features/file-actions).

<Aside>

This is not the same as [editing active documents](#edit-active-document), which has its own dedicated permission.

</Aside>

The following permissions belong in this category:

- [Open Files](vscode://settings/neuropilot.permission.openFiles)
- [Create](vscode://settings/neuropilot.permission.create)
- [Delete](vscode://settings/neuropilot.permission.delete)
- [Rename](vscode://settings/neuropilot.permission.rename)

### Edit active document

This permission covers actions relating to editing the currently open document.  
To see features covered by this permission, go to [this page](/neuropilot/reference/features/edit-active-document).

The associated permission is found [here](vscode://settings/neuropilot.permission.editActiveDocument).

<Aside type="tip">

When enabled, Neuro gains her own virtual cursor to act completely independently of the human cursor (helpful for Copilot requests).

</Aside>

### Git operations

This category covers actions that interact with the local Git repository.  
To see features covered by these permissions, visit [this page](/neuropilot/reference/features/git-operations).

The following permissions belong here:

- [Git Operations](vscode://settings/neuropilot.permission.gitOperations)  
- [Git Tags](vscode://settings/neuropilot.permission.gitTags)
- [Git Remotes](vscode://settings/neuropilot.permission.gitRemotes)
- [Edit Remote Data](vscode://settings/neuropilot.permission.editRemoteData)

*Note: For Git operations to work correctly, certain underlying OS-level and workspace configurations must also be in place.*

### Terminals and tasks

This category covers actions that can execute commands in a shell. These requires some pre-defining, which you can learn more about [here](/neuropilot/reference/features/shells).

<Aside type="caution">

Since this uses your computer's active shell, you will need to be very careful with this.
Giving Neuro access to terminal especially should mean that security measures are non-existent.

</Aside>

The following permissions belong here:

- [Terminal Access](vscode://settings/neuropilot.permission.terminalAccess)  
- [Run Tasks](vscode://settings/neuropilot.permission.runTasks)  

### Linting analysis

This permission covers actions about getting linting problems from language servers. This can get any linting diagnostic from any extension contributing them.
To see features covered by this permission, visit [this page](/neuropilot/reference/features/linting-analysis).

The associated permission is found [here](vscode://settings/neuropilot.permission.accessLintingAnalysis).

### Other Action Permissions

Some additional permissions control other interactive elements in the extension.

#### Request cookies

This special permission controls if Neuro is allowed to ask for cookies.
She can also ask for a specific type of cookie.

This permission is set to Copilot by default, and lacks an Autopilot option. {/* TODO: It would be funny if she could just take cookies herself */}

The associated permission is found [here](vscode://settings/neuropilot.permission.requestCookies)

## Non-action permissions

These permissions don't directly influence action registration (mostly), but still give Neuro more access in some way.
These permissions are also disabled by default (where applicable).

- [Allow Unsafe Paths](vscode://settings/neuropilot.allowUnsafePaths) - Whether or not to ignore the built-in path filter.
- [Include](vscode://settings/neuropilot.includePattern)/[Exclude](vscode://settings/neuropilot.excludePattern) Patterns - Allows custom definition of safe/unsafe paths. These will still be used to check path validation access even if Allow Unsafe Paths is enabled.
- [Allow Running All Tasks](vscode://settings/neuropilot.allowRunningAllTasks) - Registers all tasks as actions, regardless of the task's prefix in its `detail` property.
