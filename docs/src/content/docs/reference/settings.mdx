The following are **non-permission-related** settings in NeuroPilot.

To find the list of permission-related settings, visit [this section on Reference/Permissions](/neuropilot/reference/permissions#non-action-permissions).

## WebSocket URL :badge[Reconnect]{variant=tip}

**Default: `ws://localhost:8000`**

The address NeuroPilot will try to connect to for the Neuro Game API.
You'll need to try to [reconnect](/neuropilot/reference/commands) after changing this.

## Game Name :badge[Reconnect]{variant=tip}

**Default: `Visual Studio Code`**

The game name that will be sent to Neuro in every packet (in the `game` parameter).
You'll need to try to [reconnect](/neuropilot/reference/commands) after changing this.

<Aside>

You really shouldn't change this unless you're working with a VS Code fork, since according to the Neuro Game API spec, 'the game name should match the display name'.
Since NeuroPilot extends VS Code, the display name of the "game" is "Visual Studio Code".

</Aside>

## Initial Context :badge[Reconnect]{variant=tip}

**Default: `You are currently using an extension that allows you to code together with Vedal.`**

Sets the context that is sent to Neuro upon connection.
You'll need to try to [reconnect](/neuropilot/reference/commands) after changing this.

## Currently As Neuro API

**Default: `Neuro`**

**Options: `['Neuro', 'Evil', 'Randy', 'Jippity', 'Tony', 'Gary']`**

Changes the display name in certain areas such as (but not just) RCE requests and menu items.
If you wish, you can set a custom name by overriding the current option in `.vscode/settings.json`.
You will need to ignore the lint warn if you do that though.

<Aside>

This is mostly a cosmetic change, with one exception: To chat to Neuro/Evil/connected Neuro API server, you need to prefix your message with `@neuro`/`@evil`/`@neuroapi` respectively.
If you type the wrong name's @, the prompt will be sent to GitHub Copilot, even if the @ still highlighted in the chatbox.

</Aside>

## Docs URL :badge[Contributor]{variant=caution}

**Default: `https://vsc-neuropilot.github.io/neuropilot` (this site)**

The base URL of the docs site.

<Aside type="caution">

You should not need to change this, unless you are contributing to the docs.
Changing this setting to an untrusted website could potentially be dangerous.

</Aside>

## Before/After Context :badge[Multiple settings]{variant=success}

**Default: `10`/`10`**

The amount of lines before/after the **real** cursor to send to Neuro with inline completions, or the **virtual** cursor if Neuro is editing a file.

## Max Completions

**Default: 3**

The maximum amount of completions to request from Neuro every trigger.

## Completion Trigger

**Default: `invokeOnly`**

**Options: `["off", "invokeOnly", "automatic"]`**

The condition to request inline completions from Neuro.

<Aside type="caution">

Setting this to `automatic` will most likely overwhelm Neuro!
This is due to NeuroPilot performing many action registers, action forces, action unregisters, and contexts.

`automatic` completion triggers will trigger automatically when you stop typing.

</Aside>

## Timeout

**Default: `10000`**

The time (in milliseconds) to wait for chats and completions, before considering them cancelled.

## Include/Exclude Patterns :badge[Multiple settings]{variant=success}

**Default: `**/*`/`**/node_modules/**\n**/venv/**`**

Glob patterns that define what Neuro is/isn't allowed to open.
Separate each item with a newline character ('\n').

<Aside>

Files and folders starting with a dot will still be ignored regardless of Include Patterns.

</Aside>

## Terminals :badge[JSON-only] :badge[Permission-dependent]{variant=danger}

**Default: See object array below.**

```json
[
    {
        "name": "PowerShell",
        "path": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe",
        "args": []
    },
    {
        "name": "Command Prompt",
        "path": "C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe",
        "args": [
            "/K"
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "Git Bash",
        "path": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe",
        "args": [
            "-i"
        ]
    }
]
```

*See also: [Features/Shells - Terminals](/neuropilot/reference/features/shells#terminals)*

An array of objects that specify the shell's name, path to the shell, and args (if any) to pass in when starting them up.

## Show Time On Terminal Start :badge[Permission-dependent]{variant=danger}

**Default: `false`**

**Options: `true`, `false`**

Displays the current time (according to system clock) when starting a new terminal session.

## Terminal Context Delay :badge[Permission-dependent]{variant=danger}

**Default: `400`**

The time to wait (in ms) before sending terminal outputs to Neuro.

## Send New Linting Problems On

**Default: `off`**

**Options: `['off', 'inCurrentFile', 'inWorkspace']`**

*See also: [Features/Linting analysis - Automatic context updates](/neuropilot/reference/features/linting-analysis#automatic-context-updates)

Defines when Neuro gets automatic context updates. This will send context independent of the [`Access Linting Analysis`](/neuropilot/reference/permissions#linting-analysis) permission.

## Send Save Notifications

**Default: `true`**

**Options: `true`, `false`**

If enabled, Neuro gets notified if a file is saved.
This setting does nothing if the `Files > Auto Save` setting is set to `Off`, and does not affect whether or not Neuro gets notified if she saved manually.

## Request Expiry Timeout

**Default: `0`**

Gives how long to wait (in ms) before timing out Neuro's requests.

## Hide Copilot Requests

**Default: `false`**

**Options: `true`, `false`**

If ticked, Neuro's Copilot requests will go into a "system tray" icon at the bottom bar of VS Code.
Click the icon to reveal Neuro's request.

<Aside>

The timer starts from when Neuro sends the request, **not** when you click on the icon.
This means that you may timeout the notification while it's still sitting in the icon.

</Aside>

## Cursor Follows Neuro

**Default: `false`**

**Options: `true`, `false`**

*See also: [Reference/Cursor](/neuropilot/reference/cursor)*

Whether or not Neuro moving her cursor will move the real cursor at the same time.
Can be useful for Neuro solo coding.
