title: Extension dependencies
description: To power some of its functionality, NeuroPilot requires some extensions to be loaded to function. This is called a dependency.
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

Multiple features require another extension to work, so this page lists them so that you are sure you have the necessary extensions to function.

<Aside type="tip">

You will most likely only need to look for extension dependencies, as the dependencies from `npm` that we use should already be bundled in the extension build.

</Aside>

<Aside>

As this extension was literally **made** for Neuro to control, this also assumes you have a Neuro API server ready to go as a direct "dependency".
This also means we are using AriesAlex's [TypeScript Neuro Game SDK](https://github.com/AriesAlex/typescript-neuro-game-sdk). Thanks AriesAlex!

Don't have a Neuro-sama?
Use one of the tools listed on the official Neuro Game API repository's README ([here](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-game-sdk/?tab=readme-ov-file#tools) and [here](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-game-sdk/?tab=readme-ov-file#tools-1) specifically) instead.

## Direct dependencies

### Visual Studio Code :badge[Required (obviously)]{variant=danger}

Don't think this one needs to be explained, but there is one thing: While no guarantees it will work 100% as intended, you can try using a VS Code fork if you want (such as Cursor or VSCodium).
We will try to support VS Code forks, however we will ultimately maintain compatibility with VS Code itself even if it means breaking compatibility with forks.

### Copilot Chat :badge[Optional]{variant=success}

ID: `github.copilot-chat`

Copilot Chat allows the user to chat with Neuro on the sidebar panel.
It also powers inline completions, allowing Neuro to "complete the code".

<Aside>

You do not require a GitHub Copilot subscription to use the chat panel with NeuroPilot.

</Aside>

### Git :badge[Required]{variant=danger} :badge[Built-in]

ID: `vscode.git`

The built-in Git extension powers Neuro's ability to interact with the git repository.

<Aside type="tip">

Despite also having Git in its name, the built-in Git Base extension is not used by NeuroPilot.
You may disable that extension if you wish.

</Aside>

## Indirect dependencies

### Language servers

*Powers: Linting Analysis*

Language server extensions contribute to the Linting Analysis portion indirectly by contributing to VSCode's linting diagnostics feature, which gets listened to and pulled by the extension.

### Shells :badge[External program]

*Powers: Terminal*

To use the terminal feature, you are required to have installed shells on your computer.
