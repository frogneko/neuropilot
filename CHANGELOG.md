# NeuroPilot changelog

Since v2.1.0, we've kept a changelog of each version's changes in NeuroPilot.

Changes between each version before then will not be listed.

## 2.1.0

This update was made in response to the Evil dev stream on 2025-08-28. [Here's the VoD, courtesy of Neuro Archiver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIYaBYVX95o).

- All actions with a schema now specify `additionalProperties: false`.
  - While this is marked as "probably not supported" by the Neuro API spec, NeuroPilot checks the action against the schema via the `jsonschema` library, so enforcement will still happen, albeit on NeuroPilot's side instead of the Neuro API server.
  - If you are testing with tools like Tony or Jippity, you can safely ignore the warning.
- The NeuroPilot v1 icon now shows in the gutter (the area to the left of the line count in a file). This already did show, even on stream, but after moving all assets into /assets/ we forgot to change it on dev branch.
  - And yes, this was never pushed to production, so technically this isn't a noteworthy "change", but it's here now.
- `CNAME` (the file usually used to set a custom domain name) has now been added to the default list of Exclude Patterns that the connected Neuro twin cannot access.
- We now have a changelog! These changelogs should appear inside VS Code.
- All editing actions that move the cursor now mention in their description that the cursor moves after usage.
- Certain actions have had usage instructions clarified in their description.
- Invalid cursor positions now fail at RCE validation time instead of execution time. This should improve the experience when using Copilot mode with editing actions.
- Actions `replace_text`, `delete_text` and `find_text` now allow specifying a line range to search in.
- The context message to send the current file to the connected Neuro twin is changed to indicate that Vedal used the command.
- CRLF conversion offset has been fixed when using `insert_text`.
- Docs are now hosted at [a different subpage](https://vsc-neuropilot.github.io/docs) than before. While this isn't part of the extension itself, the link on the README file broke as a result of this change. This has now been fixed.
  - The way that the open docs commands works now is slightly different, now having a dropdown to select instead of opening our own docs directly. This is in preparation for our public API for extending NeuroPilot.
  - For now, you'll be selecting the `NeuroPilot` option most/all of the time.
- You can now optionally specify a format for line numbers in code context with the settings `lineNumberContextFormat`.
  - The `find_text` action now also uses this format.
- You can now specify how Neuro will get the cursor position with the setting `cursorPositionContextStyle`.
- Code context now includes the total number of lines in the file.
- The setting `cursorFollowsNeuro` now actually scrolls to the cursor position.
- All actions can now be individually disabled using the new setting `disabledActions`.
- Neuro will now be notified when the editor changes (e.g. by opening a file or switching to another tab).
  - By default, Neuro will get the contents of the file if it is Neuro-safe, this can be configured with the setting `sendContentsOnFileChange`.
- Changed the default context size around the cursor from 10 to 500.
- All editing actions now have a 100,000 character limit. If this is exceeded, the action will be rejected.
- Editing actions now highlight Neuro's latest edit.
  - Deletions and modifications show the deleted or replaced text as a tooltip.
  - The highlights will be cleared when the document is changed or edited.
- Added `get_content` action which sends the current file's contents. This works more or less the same as the Send Current File as Context command.
- Added `insert_lines` action which inserts text below a certain line. This also makes new lines if necessary.
- Added `rewrite_all` action which rewrites the entire file immediately.
- Added `rewrite_lines` action which rewrites text in between a specified line range and moves the cursor to the end of the last added line.
- Added `delete_lines` action which deletes text in between a specificed range and moves the cursor to the end of the line before the deleted lines.
- Added `highlight_lines` action which selects text in a specified range and moves moves the view there.
- Added `read_file` action which returns the entire contents of a file in the workspace without opening it.
